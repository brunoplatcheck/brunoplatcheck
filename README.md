# Welcome to My Repository.

## About me:
Passionate about science, technology, and constant learning. I graduated from PUC-RS, with experience in laboratory work (studies of parasites and clinical analyses) and field activities, such as visits, wildlife surveys, and management of wild animals. Additionally, I have experience in organizing academic events, such as courses, lectures, and symposiums.

I expanded my training with a specialization in Game Design, developing knowledge in 3D modeling and game development, and I am currently pursuing a technical course in Systems Development at Senac. My goal is to continue growing both professionally and personally, always learning and adapting to challenges.
